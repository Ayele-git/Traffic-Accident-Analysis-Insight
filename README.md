Project Title:
Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization US - Case

Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing records of automobile accidents across 49 states in the USA. The dataset spans from February 2016 to March 2023 and includes various features such as weather conditions, road types, accident severity, and more. The aim is to uncover patterns and insights that can aid in understanding factors contributing to road accidents and it is part of the project for Big data analysis in Emerald International collage for MSC in data science

Objectives

Data Exploration: Understand the dataset, including its features, structure, and distribution.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to better capture the relationships in the data.
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and patterns.
Visualization: Use Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights from the data.
Reporting: Provide a comprehensive report and a Power BI dashboard to communicate the findings effectively.

Scope

Geographical Scope: The dataset covers 49 states in the USA.
Temporal Scope: The data includes accidents recorded from February 2016 to March 2023.
Analytical Scope: Focus on analyzing accident severity, weather conditions, time of occurrence, road types, and other relevant factors.
Data Sources
Primary Dataset: US_Accidents_March23.csv
Source: Kaggle - US Accidents Dataset
Features: 47 columns including ID, Severity, Start_Time, End_Time, Weather_Condition, Road_Type, and more.
Project Structure
Data Ingestion: Load the data into a PySpark DataFrame and PostgreSQL for further analysis.
